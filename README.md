# Apparel Recommender using Deep Learning

This project utilizes transfer learning with TensorFlow's ResNet50 model to build an apparel recommendation system. The system scans images and displays the five closest items from the dataset on a Streamlit-based webpage.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to leverage the pre-trained ResNet50 model to extract features from apparel images and recommend visually similar items from the dataset. The process involves:

- Utilizing TensorFlow and Keras for implementing transfer learning with ResNet50.
- Building a Streamlit-based web application for user interaction and display.

## Features

- Transfer learning with ResNet50 for image feature extraction.
- Displaying the five closest apparel items based on similarity.
- Streamlit-based interface for user interaction.
